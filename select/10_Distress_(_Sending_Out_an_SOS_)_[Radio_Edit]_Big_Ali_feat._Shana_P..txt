Oh I'm tired of the fighting I wanna give it up
All we do is screaming at each other where is the love
All the things you do are just just not enough
Tell me why is this relationship so tough
Let me go here we go again
Before I go insane
The pain is running through my brain
I need to run away
Only you can make me crazy
My heart is yours for the taking
Anything that you want, girl I get it for you
No need to front baby you know I love you

I'm sending out an SOS
Can you feel my own distress
Tonight I'm letting all behind
My worries don't need them tonight

I'm sending out an SOS
Can you feel my own distress
Tonight I'm letting all behind
My worries don't need them tonight

Now she's a choosy lover
And that's word to isley bros
She's the top pick on my hot list
Like kieth sweat yeah I want her
She's my sun I'm her moon
And we kiss over the stars
Skin creamy like milkyway
Sweet like a chocolate bar of mars
So as long as I'm on earth
Her happiness is my honor
So when she sends an sos
I'm her knight in shining amour
Man I swear to see her smile
It be worth all of the drama
Then I looked her up and down and said
Mmm I got her

Only you can make me crazy
My heart is yours for the taking
Anything that you want, girl I get it for you
No need to front baby you know i love you

I'm sending out an SOS
Can you feel my own distress
Tonight I'm letting all behind
My worries don't need them tonight

I'm sending out an SOS
Can you feel my own distress
Tonight I'm letting all behind
My worries don't need them tonight

Take up your phone send me a text
These three letters is sos
Pull out your phone send me a text
These three letters is sos

I'm sending out an SOS
Can you feel my own distress
Tonight I'm letting all behind
My worries don't need them tonight

I'm sending out an SOS
Can you feel my own distress
Tonight I'm letting all behind
My worries don't need them tonight
