I felt like I finally had it all in my hands
You gave me so much strength and now all this ends
I stare into your wide open eyes
I can't move, I am shocked, I am paralyzed
When I look back now, my life has always been a mess
But you, you were the helping hand in my distress
The time is standing still
As I'm screaming down the hill, we're frozen here in time
I can't hear a sound other than my heart
Which is shattered on the ground, shattered on the ground
You always seemed like you've been walking on the air
But deep inside of you, you were screaming from despair
Ever since the day you died
I can't leave this moment behind
When I held you in my arms
And your body was still warm
Oh God
I should have seen what's going on
And now you're gone
And now you're gone
When I look back now, my life has always been a mess
But you, you were the helping hand in my distress
The time is standing still
As I'm screaming down the hill, we're frozen here in time
I can't hear a sound other than my heart
Which is shattered on the ground, shattered on the ground
Shattered on the ground
